# AWS Lambda
[AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers, creating workload-aware cluster scaling logic, maintaining event integrations, or managing runtimes. With Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service - all with zero administration.

## Examples
- [Event-Driven Computing with Amazon EventBridge and AWS Lambda](https://github.com/Young-ook/terraform-aws-lambda/blob/main/examples/eventbridge)
- [AWS Lambda with Amazon VPC](https://github.com/Young-ook/terraform-aws-lambda/blob/main/examples/vpc)

## Getting started
### AWS CLI
Follow the official guide to install and configure profiles.
- [AWS CLI Installation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html)
- [AWS CLI Configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html)

### Terraform
Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool that enables you to safely and predictably create, change, and improve infrastructure.

#### Install
This is the official guide for terraform binary installation. Please visit this [Install Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli) website and follow the instructions.

Or, you can manually get a specific version of terraform binary from the websiate. Move to the [Downloads](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) page and look for the appropriate package for your system. Download the selected zip archive package. Unzip and install terraform by navigating to a directory included in your system's `PATH`.

Or, you can use [tfenv](https://github.com/tfutils/tfenv) utility. It is very useful and easy solution to install and switch the multiple versions of terraform-cli.

First, install tfenv using brew.
```
brew install tfenv
```
Then, you can use tfenv in your workspace like below.
```
tfenv install <version>
tfenv use <version>
```
Also this tool is helpful to upgrade terraform v0.12. It is a major release focused on configuration language improvements and thus includes some changes that you'll need to consider when upgrading. But the version 0.11 and 0.12 are very different. So if some codes are written in older version and others are in 0.12 it would be great for us to have nice tool to support quick switching of version.
```
tfenv list
tfenv install latest
tfenv use <version>
```
