# AWS Step Functions

[AWS Step Functions](https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions) is a low-code visual workflow service used to orchestrate AWS services, automate business processes, and build serverless applications. Workflows manage failures, retries, parallelization, service integrations, and observability so developers can focus on higher-value business logic.
